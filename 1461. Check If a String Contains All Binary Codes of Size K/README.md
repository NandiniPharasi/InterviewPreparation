1462. Example 1:

Input: s = "00110110", k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: The binary codes of length 2 are "00", "01", "10" and "11". They can be all found as substrings at indices 0, 1, 3 and 2 respectively.

Example 2:

Input: s = "0110", k = 1
Output: true
Explanation: The binary codes of length 1 are "0" and "1", it is clear that both exist as a substring.
