Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,1,5], k = 2

Output: 1

Explanation:

Remove nums[2] = 5 to get nums = [2, 1].
Now max = 2, min = 1 and max <= min * k as 2 <= 1 * 2. Thus, the answer is 1.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,6,2,9], k = 3

Output: 2

Explanation:

Remove nums[0] = 1 and nums[3] = 9 to get nums = [6, 2].
Now max = 6, min = 2 and max <= min * k as 6 <= 2 * 3. Thus, the answer is 2.
